CryptoQuail's purpose is to extend the quality and features of other Python cryptography modules.
## Why CryptoQuail?
With CryptoQuail, you can encrypt non-built-in objects like Pandas DataFrames.
CryptoQuail's encryption module lets you encrypt strings without a long ciphertext. Some cryptography modules require you to create an object to encrypt and decrypt strings. The extra code can eat some of your bytes in the server's storage. Long ciphertexts can waste even more space in your server. CryptoQuail eliminates most side effects conventional encryptions affect your server.
## Is CryptoQuail Secure?
CryptoQuail uses a mixture of 2 XOR ciphers and a transposition cipher to encrypt and decrypt strings, but keys can easily be brute-forced by a supercomputer if the keys isn't long enough. CryptoQuail doesn't solve the key distribution problem, so it's always good to have a program that encrypts the resulting ciphertext with RSA.

CryptoQuail also has a block cipher. You can use it for more secure encryption.

## üì¶ Installation
Open your Git CMD and type:
```shell
git clone "https://github.com/cardinal9999/CryptoQuail"
cd CryptoQuail
py
```

Use `import cryptoquail` to import the CryptoQuail Package.

To use CryptoQuail in IDLE, move the `cryptoquail` folder to the directory your Python programs are in.

## üåü Features
1. üîê Complex XOR Encryption
2. üé≤ Secure Random Number Generation
3. üîè RSA Encryption
4. üîë A List of Weak Passwords
5. #Ô∏è‚É£ Secure Hashing
6. üî¢ Prime Number Generation

## Examples
Encrypt a string:
```py
from cryptoquail import encryption
print(encryption.encrypt_string("strawberry", "secret-key"))

```
## Required Modules
To access the XKCD password generator, you must have requests installed.

## üíª The CryptoQuail Website
Instead of creating a GitHub pages website (which can also eat lots of space in the package), I created some pages in a GitHub wiki.

It has a CryptoQuail tutorial for Python CryptoQuail and CryptoQuail.js.

## üéØ CryptoQuail Translations
CryptoQuail has been "translated" into other programming languages.

Note that the translations are very different from the Python version.

```diff
- Warning: When a message is encrypted with Python CryptoQuail, it can not be recovered with CryptoQuail in any other programming language.
```
## Why is it Named "CryptoQuail"?
CryptoQuail was first named "CryptoPigeon", but the name was taken. CryptoQuail was the next best name.
## üëæ Bugs and Glitches
CryptoQuail has a lot of bugs. You can help by posting an issue at https://github.com/cardinal9999/CryptoQuail/issues.
